Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Final Assignment Codebook

Overview

The presented codebook regards Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data final assignment, where students are presented with a given dataset from UCI HAR (Human Activity Recognition) and make it tidy in terms of presentation.

The following sections overview the variables/column names used. Each column in the final dataset represents an average value, for the mean/standard deviation/mean-frequency for different axis (i.e. X,Y and Z).

The mean-frequency was considered since the assignment instructions was ambiguous in terms of the mean values that should be extracted from the original dataset.
